# The Lingo

Mutual root, implement mutually

Share data structures between languages whenever possible

## Natural languages used for identifiers (Internal representations, not necessarily seen by programmers)

A mixture of Classical Chinese, Modern Chinese, Japanese and other languages

Excuse:

Formal languages are analytic languages which are not necessarily pronounceable, so I want something similar, an analytic language that does not depend on pronunciation, for identifiers.
