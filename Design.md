# Design

Mutual root, implement mutually

Share data structures between languages whenever possible

## Natural languages used for identifiers (Internal representations, not necessarily seen by programmers)

A mixture of Classical Chinese, Modern Chinese, Japanese and other languages

Excuse:

Formal languages are analytic languages which are not necessarily pronounceable, so I want something similar, an analytic language that does not depend on pronunciation, for identifiers.

## Platforms

- Scala3: JVM / JS / Native (As Application) / WASM
- Rust: Native (As Application) / WASM / Native (bare metal)
- Verilog: Hardware
